devices are read using USLOSS_DeviceInput
devices are written using USLOSS_DeviceOutput

waitDevice waits for an interrupt to fire on a given device

CLOCK
Have to implement the Sleep() system call.
-- only one process should call waitDevice
-- have a process in an infinite loop (daemon process?)
-- process increments counter each time another interrupt received
-- use mailboxes to wake up sleeping processes, when their wakeup time arrives
Clock interrupt occurs about every 100ms => 1sec = 10 interrupts

How would you implement Sleep() if only one program could call it?
-- say process A sleeps for X seconds
-- for process A, record:
    -- pid
    -- seconds to sleep for
-- call blockMe() in process A
-- somewhere else in a while(1) loop:
    -- call waitDevice
    -- increment a counter
    -- when counter = X*10, break
-- call unblockProc on the process


TERM DEVICE
1. there are four terminal devices that run in parallel
2. each can read and write one character simultaneously

16-bit CONTROL register:
-- used by the cpu to send commands to the device
    -- accessed via USLOSS_DeviceInput (READS FROM STATUS REGISTER)
    -- an interrupt is generated each time there is a change in the status register

16-bit STATUS register:
-- used by the device to send information back to the operating system
    -- accessed via USLOSS_DeviceOutput (WRITES TO CONTROL REGISTER)

USLOSS_DeviceInput READS from the STATUS register.
USLOSS_DeviceOutput WRITES to the CONTROL register.
It is IMPOSSIBLE to WRITE to the STATUS register.
It is IMPOSSIBLE to READ to the CONTROL register.

should set recv int enable bit for all terminals and leave them on
set exmit int enable bit only when there are chars to transmit on terminal

make sure to keep xmit/recv interrupts on when xmit/recv-ing chars
